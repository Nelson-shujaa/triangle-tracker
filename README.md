# Triangle Tracker
#### This is my second project, 18,02/2017
#### By **[Nelson-shujaa(https://github.com/Nelson-shujaa)**
## Description
This is a triangle tracking app.
I have designed it to track three types of triangles ie; isoceles, right-angled
triangle and equilateral triangle.
It has a simple background layout.
This is how the tracker works;
At first the tracker converts all the inputs into an integer output;
It determines whether the values meet the basic triangle criteria; if it doesn't it returns not a triangle

Then it determines whether the triangle is an equilateral triangle and returns "This is an equilateral triangle."

Then it determines whether it is a right angled triangle if it is it returns "Right angled triangle."

Else it returns "isoceles triangle".
